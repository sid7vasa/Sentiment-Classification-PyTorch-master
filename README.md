# Sentiment-Classification-PyTorch
A Simple implementation of sentiment classification using PyTorch 

## About the repository

> This code "Main.ipynb" is a simple code that uses IMDB Review dataset and learns Binary Sentiment Classification. 
> Binary Sentiment Classification is a good place to start if you are just started with NLP or even learning the PyTorch framework. 
> The code uses a 2 layer LSTM to classify the reviews either into **positive** or **negative** category.

### Requirements
* Pandas
* PyTorch
* NLTK
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* BeautifulSoup
* Jupyter

## Run
> Run all the cells using jupyter notebook. You can inference the trained LSTM model using test scripts at the end of the main.ipynb jupyter notebook.
